= Abstract

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automate key stages of modern software engineering. Hades is a build execution system designed for Artemis, an interactive learning platform for programming education. While Hades uses Kubernetes to manage build jobs, it is deployed outside the Kubernetes cluster. This implementation limits Hades's scalability and observability, increasing manual maintenance efforts.

This project migrates Hades into the Kubernetes cluster and implements a custom Kubernetes Operatortor to follow cloud-native best practices. This work will develop a helm chart to facilitate easy deployment and upgrades of Hades. This work enhances the current logging system to improve observability and implements a benchmarking suite to evaluate performance under varying conditions and identify optimization opportunities.
