= Abstract

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) play an important role in today's software engineering by automating software development, testing, and delivery. Hades is a tool designed to support large-scale build executions for Artemis, an interactive learning platform for programming education. Kubernetes is a popular open-sourced container orchestration tool that Hades currently employs to manage build jobs. However, Hades itself is deployed outside from the Kubernetes cluster. This implementation limits Hades's scalability and observability, increasing manual deployment and maintenance efforts. Additionally, Hades lacks the option of Kubernetes-native access control. This project addresses these problems by migrating Hades into a Kubernetes cluster and implementing a custom Kubernetes Operatortor to follow cloud-native best practices. Besides, the Integration of a logging mechanism will enhance the system's observability. This work will develop a helm chart to facilitate easy deployment and upgrades of Hades. Moreover, this work will also develop a benchmarking suite that accesses Hades's capabilities under various situations to identify possible improvements.
