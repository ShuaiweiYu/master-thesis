First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my parents for their unconditional love, understanding, and continuous support throughout my studies. Their encouragement has given me the opportunity to pursue higher education in Germany. They have also taught me to be a kind and responsible person, and to use what I have learned to contribute positively to society.

I am also sincerely thankful to my friends, whose company and kindness have brought me laughter and strength during both challenging and joyful times. Their support has made this journey truly memorable.

My heartfelt appreciation goes to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Stephan Krusche, and my advisor, Matthias Linhuber, M.Sc., for their invaluable guidance, patience, and insightful feedback throughout the entire research process.

Finally, I would like to thank everyone who has supported me directly or indirectly in completing this thesis. This work would not have been possible without your encouragement and trust.
