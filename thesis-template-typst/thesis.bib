  abstract = {In 2006, Fowler and Foemmel defined ten core Continuous Integration (CI) practices that could increase the speed of software development feedback cycles and improve software quality. Since then, these practices have been widely adopted by industry and subsequent research has shown they improve software quality. However, there is poor understanding of how organizations implement these practices, of the benefits developers perceive they bring, and of the challenges developers and organizations experience in implementing them. In this article, we discuss a multiple-case study of three small- to medium-sized companies using the recommended suite of ten CI practices. Using interviews and activity log mining, we learned that these practices are broadly implemented but how they are implemented varies depending on their perceived benefits, the context of the project, and the CI tools used by the organization. We also discovered that CI practices can create new constraints on the software process that hurt feedback cycle time. For researchers, we show that how CI is implemented varies, and thus studying CI (for example, using data mining) requires understanding these differences as important context for research studies. For practitioners, our findings reveal in-depth insights on the possible benefits and challenges from using the ten practices, and how project context matters.},

  abstract = {Continuous practices, i.e., continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, are the software development industry practices that enable organizations to frequently and reliably release new features and products. With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peerreviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: 1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); 2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; 3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; 4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in CI; 5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and 6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7\%) and evaluation (36.2\%) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.},

Integrating CI/CD pipelines within Kubernetes environments brings a host of benefits, enabling development teams to streamline workflows, improve efficiency, and reduce time-to-market. This integration not only automates the build, test, and deployment stages but also ensures consistency and reliability across applications. By leveraging Kubernetes' robust orchestration capabilities, development teams can manage containerized applications with ease, scale effortlessly, and handle complex deployments seamlessly. This abstract explores the integration of CI/CD pipelines in Kubernetes, highlighting the key advantages such as enhanced collaboration, improved code quality, and faster iteration cycles. It discusses how the synergy between CI/CD and Kubernetes fosters an environment of continuous improvement and agility, allowing organizations to respond swiftly to market demands and deliver high-quality software at a rapid pace. The discussion also touches upon practical aspects, including best practices for setting up CI/CD pipelines in Kubernetes, common challenges faced, and solutions to overcome these hurdles. In essence, this abstract provides a comprehensive overview of how CI/CD pipelines in Kubernetes serve as a catalyst for efficient software development and deployment, ultimately driving innovation and competitive advantage in the digital era.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, novel software architectural patterns, such as microservices, have emerged to improve application modularity and to streamline their development, testing, scaling, and component replacement. To support these new trends, new practices as DevOps methodologies and tools, promoting better cooperation between software development and operations teams, have emerged to support automation and monitoring throughout the whole software construction lifecycle. That affected positively several IT companies, but also helped the transition to the softwarization of complex telco infrastructures in the last years. Container-based technologies played a crucial role by enabling microservice fast deployment and their scalability at low overhead; however, modern container-based applications may easily consist of hundreds of microservices services with complex interdependencies and call for advanced orchestration capabilities. While there are several emerging container orchestration engines, such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Apache Mesos, and Cattle, a thorough functional and performance assessment to help IT managers in the selection of the most appropriate orchestration solution is still missing. This paper aims to fill that gap. Collected experimental results show that Kubernetes outperforms its counterparts for very complex application deployments, while other engines can be a better choice for simpler deployments.},

This paper investigates the effects of modeling of such systems, by applying two continuous integration modeling techniques to four separate industry cases in three companies. These techniques are found to complement each other, and their ability to help professionals gain a better understanding of their continuous integration systems, to communicate around them and to support technical work is demonstrated. In addition, guidelines for conducting similar continuous integration modeling work are presented and feedback on the studied models provided. This work presents software professionals with demonstrably effective methods for design and analysis of continuous integration systems and thereby improving the efficacy of a vital part of their software development efforts, while supporting researchers with recommendations for and feedback on available modeling techniques.},

  abstract = {Build automation is critical for developers to check if their code compiles, passes all tests and is safe to deploy to the server. Many companies adopt Continuous Integration (CI) services to make sure that the code changes from multiple developers can be safely merged at the head of the project. Internally, CI triggers builds to make sure that the new code change compiles and passes the tests. For any large company which has a monolithic code repository and thousands of developers, it is hard to make sure that all code changes are safe to submit in a timely manner. The reason is that each code change may involve multiple builds, and the company needs to run millions of builds every day to guarantee developers’ productivity.},
