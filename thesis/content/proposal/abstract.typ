= Abstract

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automate key stages of modern software engineering. Hades is a scalable build execution system designed for programming exercise environments, with Artemis being one of its potential integration platforms. While Hades uses Kubernetes to manage build jobs, it is deployed outside the Kubernetes cluster. This implementation limits Hades's scalability and observability, increasing manual maintenance efforts.

This project migrates Hades into the Kubernetes cluster and implements a custom Kubernetes Operator to follow cloud-native best practices. This work will develop a helm chart to facilitate easy deployment and upgrades of Hades. This work enhances the current logging system by collecting and aggregating build execution logs within the Kubernetes cluster to improve observability and implements a benchmarking suite to evaluate performance under varying conditions and identify optimization opportunities.
