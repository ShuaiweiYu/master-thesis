We identiÔ¨Åed four major problems in the current Hades setting this work aims to address. The scope of the work is to enhance the Hades using native Kurbernetes and improve the maintenability and obervability.

First, Hades is deployed manually and externally from the Kubernetes cluster. This setup requires administrators to handle deployment, upgrades, and recovery manually, increasing the risk of human error. The current Hades setup has no self-recovery mechanisms and is prone to single points of failure. During periods of high usage, such as exams, the gateway may become overloaded, leading to higher latency and a degraded user experience.

Second, the current Hades Kubernetes implementation is not optimized. Hades has not yet leveraged the benefits of Kubernetes native API objects and has no load-balancing mechanism. This will lead to imbalanced resource allocation and poor performance, impacting the user experience and becoming the bottleneck in the whole system. 

Third, Hades lacks the monitoring and logging support for the Kubernetes Operator. It is difficult to trace the system status without a robust monitoring and logging system. It is also crucial to deliver the build logs to the external trigger system so that the trigger system will understand the results of the build jobs in order to identify the mistakes in case of build failures.

Fourth, no benchmarking framework for Hades is available, making the measurement and analysis of Hades's performance difficult. Without standardized benchmarks, the developer and the administrators will have problems understanding Hades's performance under different circumstances. This hinders the developer from improving Hades's capability under high concurrent situations and complicates efforts to identify bottlenecks.
